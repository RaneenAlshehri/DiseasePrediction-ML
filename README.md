# DiseasePrediction-ML
The purpose of constructing this project called “Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning” is 
to predict the accurate disease of the patient using all their general information’s 
and also the symptoms. 

## Dataset
The dataset we will use in our project is Disease Prediction consists of 2 CSV files. One of them is for training and the other is for testing your model. Each CSV file has 133 columns. 132 of these columns are symptoms that a person experiences and the last column is the prognosis. And making the task of physicians easy is the main purpose of this dataset. Determined by the type of disease using the Random Forest model.

## Data Collection
Disease Prediction dataset
from Kaggle, and this is the website

Because our project is Disease Prediction
Using a Machine Learning scenario, we need
to choose a dataset containing various
diseases. The dataset selected is the best
between different data on the same subject
because it contains many types of diseases
and symptoms.

## Machine Learning Model
We have tried multiple
prediction models but using
the Random Forest classifier
model has shown the best
results:

* Random Forest classifier
